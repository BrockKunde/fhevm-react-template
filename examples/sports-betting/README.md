# Confidential Sports Betting Platform

A privacy-first sports betting platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling completely confidential wagering on the blockchain.

## üîê Core Concept

This platform leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create a trustless, privacy-preserving sports betting experience. Unlike traditional betting platforms, all bet amounts, predictions, and user data remain encrypted on-chain, ensuring complete confidentiality while maintaining the transparency and security of blockchain technology.

### Key Features

- **Private Betting**: All wagers and predictions are encrypted using FHE, protecting user privacy
- **Confidential Odds**: Betting odds and pool sizes remain encrypted until match settlement
- **Secure Rewards**: Automated reward distribution through encrypted smart contracts
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify wins without revealing bet details
- **On-Chain Privacy**: Complete transaction privacy while maintaining blockchain immutability

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Match Creation**: Operators create encrypted betting markets for upcoming sports events
2. **Place Bets**: Users submit encrypted bets on match outcomes (win/lose, over/under, handicap)
3. **Encrypted Processing**: All calculations happen on encrypted data without decryption
4. **Match Settlement**: Oracle submits results, contracts calculate payouts on encrypted values
5. **Claim Winnings**: Winners receive payouts automatically with full privacy protection

## üèÜ Supported Bet Types

- **Win/Lose/Draw**: Predict the match outcome
- **Over/Under**: Total goals/points threshold betting
- **Handicap Betting**: Encrypted handicap wagering
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Privacy-preserving reward system for active bettors

## üì° Smart Contract

**Contract Address**: `0xB539bf7D5960087A2742B8Fd2DceA8aE86E6E516`

**Network**: Zama Sepolia Testnet

The smart contract implements FHE operations using the fhEVM framework, enabling:
- Encrypted bet storage and processing
- Private odds calculations
- Confidential pool management
- Secure payout distribution
